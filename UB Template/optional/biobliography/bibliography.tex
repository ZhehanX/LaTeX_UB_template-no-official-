Using \texttt{biblatex} you can display a bibliography divided into sections, depending on citation type. 
Let's cite! Einstein's journal paper \cite{einstein} and Dirac's book \cite{dirac} are physics-related items. 
Next, \textit{The \LaTeX\ Companion} book \cite{latexcompanion}, Donald Knuth's website \cite{knuthwebsite}, \textit{The Comprehensive Tex Archive Network} (CTAN) \cite{ctan} are \LaTeX-related items; but the others, Donald Knuth's items, \cite{knuth-fa,knuth-acp} are dedicated to programming.
